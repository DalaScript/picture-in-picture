# Picture in Picture | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 3/20**

A minimalist Picture-in-Picture (PiP) web app that allows users to share their screen and pop it out into a floating video window using the browser's native Picture-in-Picture API. Clean design, one-click interaction, and a focused learning experience on media APIs.
