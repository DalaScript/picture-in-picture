# Picture in Picture | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 3/20**

A minimalist Picture-in-Picture (PiP) web app that allows users to share their screen and pop it out into a floating video window using the browser's native Picture-in-Picture API. Clean design, one-click interaction, and a focused learning experience on media APIs.

## 🧠 My Process

### 🛠️ Built with

 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - Vanilla JavaScript
 - Picture-in-Picture Web API
 - MediaDevices API (`getDisplayMedia()`)

### 🎓 What I Learned

 - How to work with `getDisplayMedia()` to capture the screen

 - Managing DOM elements and user interaction state (e.g., disabling button while PiP is active)
 - Creating clean UI with shadows, gradients, and responsive centering

  > 🚀 For me, this project was more about **practice** and gaining additional **experience**,  
  > rather than learning something entirely new.  
  >  
  > 👨‍💻 Since I’m not a beginner and already familiar with these technologies,  
  > I approached it with confidence — and still, I truly **enjoyed working on it**.  
  >  
  > 🎯 Overall, I consider this a very **valuable and enjoyable experience**.
