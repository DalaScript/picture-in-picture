# Picture in Picture | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 3/20**

A minimalist Picture-in-Picture (PiP) web app that allows users to share their screen and pop it out into a floating video window using the browser's native Picture-in-Picture API. Clean design, one-click interaction, and a focused learning experience on media APIs.

  > 🚀 For me, this project was more about **practice** and gaining additional **experience**,  
  > rather than learning something entirely new.  
  >  
  > 👨‍💻 Since I’m not a beginner and already familiar with these technologies,  
  > I approached it with confidence — and still, I truly **enjoyed working on it**.  
  >  
  > 🎯 Overall, I consider this a very **valuable and enjoyable experience**.
